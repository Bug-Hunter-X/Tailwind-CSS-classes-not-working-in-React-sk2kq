# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in React projects: Tailwind classes not being applied to elements.

## Problem Description

Tailwind classes, even when correctly imported, fail to apply styles to components, making the project look unstyled, which can lead to incorrect styling and visual issues.

## Solution

The problem is usually caused by incorrect setup of Tailwind CSS in the project.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation. In `bugSolution.js`, the issue is solved by:

1.  **Correctly importing Tailwind CSS:** Ensure `tailwindcss/tailwind.css` is correctly imported into your main application file (e.g., `index.js`, `App.js`, `main.js` etc.).
2.  **Using a build process:** Tailwind CSS requires a build process (like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel) to process and inject the styles into your application. If you don't have one, setting up a simple build process is recommended.
3.  **Purge unused styles:**  While not always necessary, setting up Tailwind's purge configuration can help to minimize the final CSS bundle size by removing unused styles.
